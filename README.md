Short Answer Questions
Q1: How AI-Driven Code Generation Tools Reduce Development Time (and Their Limitations) AI tools like GitHub Copilot accelerate coding by suggesting code snippets, automating boilerplate tasks, and learning from context to offer intelligent autocompletions. They help developers focus on logic and architecture rather than syntax. However, limitations include:
Incomplete understanding of business logic
Potential security vulnerabilities in suggestions
Reinforcing poor coding practices if unchecked
Dependency riskâ€”developers may rely too heavily on suggestions
Feature	Supervised Learning	Unsupervised Learning
Data Requirement	Labeled (bug vs. no bug)	Unlabeled
Use Case	Known bug types	Unknown or emerging bugs
Example	Classify SQL injection errors	Detect memory anomalies or code smells
Supervised learning excels in structured environments; unsupervised shines when patterns are unknown.
Q3: Why Bias Mitigation Is Critical in UX Personalization Personalized systems that lack bias mitigation may alienate users or reinforce harmful stereotypes. For example, biased training data may suggest different job ads to users based on gender. Mitigation ensures inclusivity, fairness, and a more ethical experience. It builds trust and avoids marginalizing minority groups.
Case Study: AIOps in Deployment Pipelines
How AIOps Improves Efficiency AIOps applies AI to automate repetitive DevOps tasks and enhance pipeline performance. Two examples include:
Log pattern recognition: Detects performance bottlenecks and alerts teams before failures occur.
Auto-resolution: Executes predefined actions (e.g., rollback) when deployment metrics deviate unexpectedly, reducing downtime.
